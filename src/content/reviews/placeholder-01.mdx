## Who it's for

Creators who want transcript-first editing for podcasts, clips, and social snippets. Standout features: text-based editing, overdub, and easy multicam alignment.

## Verdict

Fantastic for podcasters and video creators who work with dialogue-heavy content. The text-based editing workflow is genuinely faster than traditional timeline editing once you adapt to it.

## First Impressions

When I first opened Descript, I was immediately struck by how different it felt from traditional video editors. Instead of a timeline filled with waveforms and video tracks, I saw a transcript. This is Descript's killer feature: **you edit video by editing text**.

### Setup Process

Getting started was straightforward:

1. Import your media files
2. Wait for automatic transcription
3. Start editing by deleting words

The transcription took about 2 minutes for a 15-minute video, which is impressive. The accuracy was around 95% on first pass, with most errors being minor punctuation or capitalization issues.

## Standout Features

### Text-Based Editing

> "Editing video feels like editing a document. Delete a sentence, and the video trims automatically. It's mind-blowing when you first see it."

The text-based editing workflow is genuinely revolutionary. Here's how it works:

- **Delete words** to remove them from the video
- **Rearrange sentences** to reorder clips
- **Highlight text** to see the corresponding video segment

### Overdub Voice Cloning

The overdub feature lets you:

- Clone your voice after a short training session
- Generate new speech from text
- Fix mistakes without re-recording

**Quality**: The voice cloning is scarily accurate. Listeners can't tell the difference between original and overdubbed audio in most cases.

### Multicam Alignment

Switching between camera angles is seamless:

| Feature | Performance | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Auto Sync | Excellent | Works even with different audio sources |
| Manual Override | Good | Easy to fine-tune if needed |
| Export Quality | Very Good | Maintains original resolution |

## Pricing Breakdown

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Best For |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| Free | $0 | - | Basic transcription |
| Creator | $24 | $20/mo | Solo creators |
| Pro | $48 | $40/mo | Teams and professionals |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Large organizations |

**Final Score**: The pricing is competitive but not cheap. The Creator plan feels like the sweet spot for most users.

## What We Liked

- **Fast workflow**: Text editing is genuinely faster than timeline editing
- **Accurate transcription**: Rarely needed manual corrections

## What Could Be Better

- **Steeper learning curve**: Takes time to unlearn traditional editing habits
- **Limited effects**: Not as feature-rich as Premiere or Final Cut
- **Export restrictions**: Some formats locked behind higher tiers
- **Resource usage**: Can be heavy on CPU during rendering

### Podcast Editing

### Bottom Line

Descript earns its reputation as a revolutionary editing tool. The text-based workflow takes getting used to, but once you adapt, you'll wonder how you ever edited without it. At $24/month, it's worth it for creators who regularly edit spoken content.

The overdub feature alone can save hours of re-recording, and the transcription accuracy is impressive. While it's not a replacement for professional video editors like Premiere Pro, it's an excellent tool for specific use cases.

**Rating**: 4.3/5 - Excellent tool for its niche, with room for improvement in effects and advanced features.
