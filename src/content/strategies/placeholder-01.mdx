## Overview

This plan breaks your first 90 days into three focused sprints: calibration, consistency, and compounding.

## 0–30 days: Calibration

Define audience, messaging pillars, and frictionless publishing setup. Publish 3–5 small bets per week.

## 31–60 days: Consistency

Introduce recurring series, improve hooks, and double-down on validated angles.

## 61–90 days: Compounding

Add distribution loops, collaborations, and light offers to convert attention into outcomes.
