## What changed in 2024

TikTok now weighs session contribution more heavily. That means content that keeps people on-platform ranks higher.

### Key shifts

- Shorter hooks, faster payoffs
- Loops and callbacks
- Serial content formats

## Format blueprint

| Step | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Hook (0-2s) | Pattern interrupt, explicit promise |
| Delivery (2-12s) | Fast cuts, on-screen text, artifact continuity |
| Callback (12-18s) | Fulfill promise, cue replay |

> Creators who script callbacks see up to 27% higher replays.

## Action plan

1. Write 3 hooks for every idea
2. Film in batches of 10
3. Analyze last 20 posts for 3-second drop-off

### Metrics to track

- 3s hold rate
- Average watch time
- Replays per view

Thatâ€™s the engine. Now iterate weekly.
